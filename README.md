# Words transformer

## What does it do?

Words transformer is an amazing Java program that looks for a word (of group of words) in a text file, and replace this word with something else. The "something else" is up to the user, as he has different options (encrypt the word with a Caesar code, switch all the letters to uppercase or lowercase, take all the letters and rearrange them in alphabetical order, etc.)
